## API Tokens

Creating an API key is for Rectify Premium users. Creating an API key allows Rectify to identify your Discord server while using our services. API keys allow users to use premium commands and access premium only endpoints. API keys are currently used for the Rectify: Admin Panel. Once you have obtained premium you may create an API key by running /createkey in your serve once you have successfully linked your server to Roblox by running /linkguild GROUPID.
